Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining software systems.It is crucial in todays tech industry because nearly everything we use such as apps, websites and more relies on technology. 
 Engineers ensures the software is reliable, secure, and solving real world problems.Without it, modern technology and progress wouldnâ€™t be possible.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-AI, Engineers started building smart software that learns from data collection and help people with prompts.
-Cloud Computing, Platforms like AWS and Google Cloud let developers build and scale apps without physical servers making the software faster and more accessible.
-DevOps, Teams combined development and operations to release updates quicker and more reliably, using tools like Docker to automate workflows.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements Gathering, Understand what the software needs to do by collecting data from users.
-Design, Plan how the software will work.
-Implementation, Write the required code based on the design.
-Testing, Check for bugs and errors to ensure it works efficiently.
-Deployment, Release the software to users.
-Maintenance to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features based on users feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall is a rigid and planned upfront while Agile is flexible and evolves with feedback. We use Waterfall for predictable projects while Agile for changing ones.
-Agile is appropriate for Projects with evolving needs or frequent feedback (e.g. mobile apps)
-Waterfall is appropriate for a Stable and well defined projects (e.g. medical device software)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer
 role is to build the software, and responsibilities is to Write, test, and fix code to create functional and efficient software.
-Quality Assurance Engineer
 role is to ensure quality, and responsibilities is to test software for bugs, reports issues, and verifies fixes to meet quality standards.
-Project Manager
 role is to Keep the project on track, and responsibilities is to Plan timelines, manage resources, and coordinate the team to deliver the project on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs
 Importance is to simplify coding with tools like editors, debuggers, and compilers in one place.
 Examples VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.
-Version Control Systems 
 Importance is to track code changes, enable teamwork, and allow reverting to older versions.
 Examples Git (with GitHub/GitLab), Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing Requirements
 Challenge: Stakeholders often change or add requirements mid-project.
 Strategy: Use Agile methodologies to adapt quickly. Regularly communicate with stakeholders to align expectations.
-Tight Deadlines
 Challenge: Unrealistic timelines can lead to rushed work and bugs.
 Strategy: Break projects into smaller tasks with clear priorities. Use project management tools to track progress and adjust timelines as needed.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing: Tests individual code components in isolation.
 Importance: Catches bugs early.
-Integration Testing: Tests how different modules work together.
 Importance: Ensures smooth interaction between parts.
-System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole.
 Importance: Verifies end to end functionality.
-Acceptance Testing: Tests with real users or stakeholders.
 Importance: Confirms the software meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting clear specific prompts to guide AI models like ChatGPT for better results.
 It's importance is to improve accuracy and relevance and to save time by reducing back and forth.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague Prompt "Tell me about computers."
-Improved Prompt "Explain how a CPU works, focusing on processing instructions, in simple terms for a beginner."
 It's better because it is a concise, relevant, and beginner-friendly explanation.
